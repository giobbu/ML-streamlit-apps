# Mixtures of Gaussians and the EM algorithm

In the unsupervised learning setting we are given a training set  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{x^{(1)}, ..., x^{(n)}\}"> without any labels.
We wish to model the data by a joint distribution <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)})"> where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z^{(i)}">â€™s are latent (unobserved) random variables.
